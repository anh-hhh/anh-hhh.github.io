Anh was new to my business when I walked her through an automation that
required a complex weave of many different tools, scenarios, combinations of
variables and moving parts. As I went through what was needed, I paused and
said: "I'm sorry Anh. I know it's like a Rubikâ€™s cube." Anh replied
matter-of-factly and said: "It takes me a minute to solve the Rubik's cube."

Anh learns new tools and skills at the speed of light. She executes faster than
the speed of light. She catches mistakes before they come up, and she keeps her
eye on the big picture and on every detail. During my last launch, she would
troubleshoot at all hours, and for long hours - exhilarated by every challenge.
And she does it all with grace, ego free, and with a sparkle in her eye. She
loves the work and will treat your business like it's her baby.
