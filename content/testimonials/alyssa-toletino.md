What I appreciate the most about Anh is I don't have to go into detail when
discussing systems. I tell her the objective, she strategizes on the user
experience for both my team AND the client, and she executes. Systems used to
be a huge pain in the butt until Anh came onboard. 

<!--more-->

When Anh works along my side, I truly feel as though I have a collaborative
partner. She hears out my concerns, and my vision for the systems and
automations. If a system is incapable of doing what I'd like for it to do, she
comes back with alternatives. She never comes back empty handed. 

Anh strategizes on my internal systems, as well as with our client's systems.
She's confident in her capabilities (as she should be!), and joins me on
strategy sessions with clients to hear their thoughts and concerns. She
provides not only myself support, but our VIP clients. She also leads other
team members within our agency to fill in any gaps when necessary. 

What is Anh really good at that helped you in your business? (Some examples:
leadership, communication, mindset, motivation, vision, skillset, business
strategy, etc.) In the online space especially right now, systems and
automations are essential for every aspect within the business. Anh has taken
over this component completely. As of right now, she is directing her own
department (systems), and assembles team members as needed. This has provided
me with more than enough motivation to start scaling our agency even larger as
I am confident with Anh by my side we have no limits. 

We now have room for growth. With our services, business management, systems
optimization and integration is a main part of our services. We've had team
members in Anh's role before, but unfortunately, it required high involvement
from myself which is not scalable. With Anh managing one of the largest
components of our services, the glass ceiling over my head has been removed. 

Anyone who needs not only systems set up and optimization, but STRATEGY. Anh
understands the bigger picture, and knows how to ensure all the systems in this
picture are seamless, talk to each other, and provide a user experience for
both the internal team and clients that is seamless, streamlined, and hassle
free. If you'd like to move in big strides, you need Anh.
