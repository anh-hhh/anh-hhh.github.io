I went to law school for 3 years just to realize that there's more potential to
change lives from running a business than being a lawyer at some corporate
typing my life away. I decided to drop out and have been pursuing the role of
the right-hand woman for online business owners whose mission is to better
lives ever since.

**Interests:** startups, computer science, psychology, neuroscience, mental
health, yoga, comedy, arts, films, memoirs, classical piano, music production,
languages, healthy lifestyle, travels, minimalism.
